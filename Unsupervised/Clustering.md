# Clustering performance evaluation
- Rand index
- Mutual Information based scores
- Homogeneity, completeness and V-measure
- Fowlkes-Mallows scores 1983
- Silhouette Coefficient
  - a higher Silhouette Coefficient score relates to a model with better defined clusters.
- Calinski-Harabasz Index 1974
  - 優點
    - The score is higher when clusters are dense and well separated, which relates to a standard concept of a cluster.
    - The score is fast to compute 
- Davies-Bouldin Index 1979
